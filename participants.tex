\section*{VÃ­ctor Ruiz Herrero}
(rufyzos)

I  have  studied  maths  in  FME,  I  would  like  to  learn  a  lot  of  geometry  in  this course and in the future I would like to be a doctor in Mathematics.

\section*{Xavier Gombau Pascual}
(xavi-gombau)

I have studied a degree in Telecommunications Engineering for the last 4 years here in Barcelona, at UPC. This course, I would like to study computation-related topics and code a little bit! I'm not sure what to do in a near future, but I have some ideas as an entrepreneur. Looking forward to enjoy this course!

\section*{Esteve Tarrago Sanchis}

I  studied computer science and industrial engineering at UPC. There we study some discrete and applied math. I would like to learn more about geometry, and in particular those structures useful to model real-world. One topic that I may focus on the future is reinforcement learning applied on to robots policies. 

\section*{Diego Acedo Moscoso}

I studied a Degree in Mathematics in the University of Cadiz. I am interested mostly in group theory, but I'm also keen on measure theory and algebraic topology, and I do not really dislike many parts of mathematics. I have not learned much geometry before, so I hope with this course I can get some ideas.
I am not sure about my future yet. After finishing this master, I plan to get some job experience, and hopefully some years later I will try to do a Ph.D.

\section*{Sahar Hakim}
(saharhakim)

I have done my Bachelor in Pure Mathematics in Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse/France. I am interested in following this master and I am planning to continue my PHD but didn't decide yet in which field.
